# Markdown
```markdown
# Hello World

This is **Markdown**

<!-- plain html works in markdown too, like this comment -->
```
**Markdown** is a lightweight 'Markup' language for formatting plaintext, and 
viewing it in a web browser.
- **All** the "*notes*" you read on this site are written in markdown

- Language Features:
    - Headings
    - Numbered/Bulleted Lists
    - Checklists
    - Tables
    - Images 
    - Links
    - Emoji support 😄 🤙


- Very simple syntax, easy to learn
    - "EZ mode HTML" -- [HTML 🗒️](/on/html) is another example of a 'Markup' 
    language

- Easy conversion to pdf or html if needed
    - see Pandoc

- Often used for README's (README.md)
    - ie: GitHub and GitLab

- Github.com uses its own variant of Markdown, called GFM
    + **GFM** -- Github Flavored Markdown
    + [see Official GFM Page 🌐](https://github.github.com/gfm/#what-is-github-flavored-markdown-)

> The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as 
readable 
> as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be 
publishable as-is, 
> as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or 
formatting instructions.
