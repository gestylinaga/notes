# TypeScript
```typescript
let someString: string = "This is TypeScript";
let someNumber: number = 324;
let someBool: boolean;

function helloWorld() {
  console.log(someString);
}

helloWorld()
```
**TypeScript** is a *strongly typed* programming language that builds 
on [JavaScript](/on/javascript). It is a strict superset of JavaScript, 
meaning that you can write plain JavaScript in a `.ts` file, and the extra 
features of TypeScript are completely optional. This is because TypeScript acts 
like a compiled language, that eventually compiles into regular old JavaScript.

## Advantages
- Strong static typing
- Error checking before runtime
- Practically no learning curve if you know JavaScript
- Compile into any version of JavaScript (for browser backwards compatability)

## Compiler
The TypeScript compiler, **tsc**, can be configured by modifying the 
`tsconfig.json`. 

A simple, default config can be generated by running:
```bash
tsc --init
```
which contains several options commented out.

Without a `tsconfig.json` file, you **must** include the filename to compile:
```bash
tsc someFile.ts
```
however, if a `tsconfig.json` exists in the path, simply running:
```bash
tsc
```
will automatically compile any typescript files.

### Watch Flag
```bash
tsc -w
```
Passing the `-w` flag when calling the compiler, will allow `tsc` to "*watch*" 
for any changes, and automatically compile in the background. Alternatively, 
you can add:
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "watch": true
  }
}
```
to your `tsconfig.json` to do the same.
