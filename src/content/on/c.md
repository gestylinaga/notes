# C
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    printf("This is C");
}
```
**C** is a staticly-typed, procedural programming language considered to 
be the mother of all programming languages. Its use can be seen in:
  - The Windows, Linux, **and** Mac operating system kernels
  - Databases (like MySQL)
  - Interpreters for other languages (like [Python 🗒️](/on/python))
  - Developer tools (like Vim and Git)

The language was created in 1972 and used to develop the 
[UNIX 🌐](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) operating system.

C's syntax "inspired" the syntax of countless other programming languages 
that came after like:
- C++
- C#
- Java
- Perl
- [JavaScript 🗒️](/on/javascript)
- [PHP 🗒️](/on/php)

It is a *compiled* language, as opposed to an *interpreted* language.
- Compiles directly into machine code 
- Platform dependant
  - Executables run on specific operating system, and not any others

## High-Level Language with Low-Level Control
High-Level as in "designed to be readable by humans" but,

with Low-Level Control over memory and hardware.
- No "garbage collector" 
  - something to free up memory you aren't using
  - meaning you must manage memory manually, or your program will "leak" memory
