```
**Python** is a high-level general-purpose programming language that excels in:
* Data Science
* Machine Learning/AI
* Automation/Scripting
* and more...

It is an *interpreted* language, as opposed to a *compiled* language

There is a **very** important distinction between Python 2.x.x and Python 3.x.x
- `Python3` is the most recent version
- `Python 2.x.x` is no longer under development and will be discontinued 
eventually

**Easy to Learn**:
* simple syntax -- basically *pseudocode*
* wide-spread support -- extensive standard library/external resources
* Python interpreter allows for quick testing, no compiling wait time

## Pip
Python has its own package manager, called Pip, and its own repository of 
software you can import from, called the 
[Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/).
