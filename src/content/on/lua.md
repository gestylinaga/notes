**Lua** is a fast, lightweight, and embeddable scripting/programming language. 
It is widely considered the *fastest* interpreted/scripting language.

Its "virtual machine" maps very closely to the 
[C programming language 🗒️](/on/c), and when combined with its Just-In-Time 
compiler, **LuaJIT**, it's faster than [Python 🗒️](/on/python) and 
[JavaScript 🗒️](/on/javascript).

In addition to speed, Lua's complete source code and documentation is only 
1.3 MB in size, making it very portable/embeddable.

It has seen widespread use in video-game development:
  - World of Warcraft
  - Dark Souls
  - Fable II 
  - Gary's Mod
  - Roblox

## C APIs
[Overview of C API - Lua Official Docs 🌐](http://www.lua.org/pil/24.html)

Lua's extensive C API allows easy integration, letting you call lua code in a C 
program, or vice-versa, call C code in a Lua program.

## LuaRocks
Lua has its own package manager, called **LuaRocks**.
