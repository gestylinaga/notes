# Markdown
```markdown
# Hello World

This is **Markdown**
```
Markdown is a lightweight 'Markup' language for formatting plaintext, and veiwing it 
in a web browser.
- Language Features:
    - Headings
    - Numbered/Bulleted Lists
    - Checklists
    - Tables
    - Images 
    - Links
    - Emoji support

- Very simple syntax, easy to learn
    - "EZ mode HTML" -- [HTML](../html) is another example of a 'Markup' language

- All the 'notes' you read on this site are written in markdown

- Easy conversion to pdf or html if needed
    - see Pandoc

- Often used for README's (README.md)
    - ie: Github and Gitlab

- Github.com uses its own variant of Markdown, called GFM
    + **GFM** -- Github Flavored Markdown
    + [see Official GFM Page](https://github.github.com/gfm/#what-is-github-flavored-markdown-)

> The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable 
> as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, 
> as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.
