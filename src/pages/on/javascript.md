**JavaScript** is a high-level, single-threaded, *interpreted* language, that is 
most known for building websites. Its creator, Brendan Eich's, original goal was 
to add an "easy to learn" scripting language to the Netscape Browser. Nowadays 
JavaScript is considered a fully-featured language that continues to grow 
according to the [ECMA Standard](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-262/).

It is most well-known for building "front-end" web applications, because it is 
the only language (other than [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/)) that is 
run natively in web browsers (like Mozilla FireFox or Google Chrome).

JavaScript works in conjunction with HTML and CSS to provide complete websites.

## Atwood's Law
> "Any application that *can* be written in JavaScript, *will* eventually be 
written in JavaScript." - Atwood's Law 
> - Jeff Atwood (Cofounder of StackOverflow)

JavaScript can also:
- create server side applications with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
- create mobile applications with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) or 
[Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/).
- create desktop applications with [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/).

This is because JavaScript is an *interpreted* scripted language, but tools like 
the [V8 engine](https://v8.dev/) in Google Chrome, use a 
["Just-In-Time(JIT)"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation) 
compiler to convert it to machine code at runtime.

## NPM
JavaScript has its own package manager, called NPM, specifically for the runtime 
environment Node.js.
