**Ruby** is a dynamically, interpreted, scripting language. It is made famous 
for taking *simplicity* and *code-readability* to the extreme. 

It was created in 1993 to be an easy-to-use scripting language like 
[Python](/notes/on/python), but with genuine Object Oriented features (OOP). It 
grew in popularity with the creation of Rails (aka Ruby on Rails) in 2005, 
Model, View, Controller (MVC) framework. 

The two combined have been used to make:
- Twitter
- Shopify
- Airbnb
- GitHub

## RubyGems
Ruby comes with it's own package manager called RubyGems, with each individual 
packages called a "*gem*".
