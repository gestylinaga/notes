**Cascading Style Sheets**
```css
/* This is CSS */
body {
    background: black;
    color: white;
    font-family: Helvetica;
}
```
**CSS** is a stylesheet language famous for making websites pretty. CSS works 
with HTML to style an otherwise boring black & white page.

It was first released in 1996, and evolved into **CSS3** by 1999. Although the 
language still receives updates, there are no plans to make a "CSS4".

CSS selects elements from the HTML document, and applies "rules" that change the 
appearance of said element.

"***Cascading***" in CSS refers to the fact that multiple rules can be placed 
on a single element, and the order/heirarchy of CSS rules apply in order. This 
also means that elements can "inherit" rules from their parent element.

CSS works in conjunction with HTML and JavaScript to provide complete websites.
