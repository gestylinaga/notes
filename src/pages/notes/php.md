**PHP**, Hypertext Preprocessor, or **P**ersonal **H**ome **P**age, as it was 
originally named, is a dynamic, interpreted, scripting language, made for 
building interactive websites on the server.

Even though it's old, and mostly pronounced '*dead*', it remains one of the 
most popular languages for backend web-development. (Also good to know because, 
it used to be **so** popular, a lot of websites will have some PHP somewhere).

It is used in:
- Content Management Systems (CMS) like Wordpress
- Websites like Wikipedia
- others via frameworks like Laravel & Symfony

It predates [JavaScript](./javascript), and was one of the first languages to be 
embedded directly  into [HTML](./html), allowing websites to be built 
dynamically on a server.
